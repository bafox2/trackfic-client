# Trackfic
This website started with my frustrations with how Google Maps responds to routes in the future. The static range they give isn't really enough to make a decision about when to leave, and I knew that there was more information publicly available.

# What does it do? 
Query the Google Distance Matrix API to get an average trip duration, along with the specific trip duration when you would like to make your trip. If you're considering whether you should leave around 6:00, 7:00, or 8:00, but need more information, this is for you!
